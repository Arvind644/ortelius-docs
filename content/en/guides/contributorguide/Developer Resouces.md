## Developer Tools

### Editors

### Testing Environment

To setup your environment to create a runtime test environment: 
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- GCloud 
- Azure

### Git

To submit issues and manage pull request:
- [Git GUIs](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/)

Getting started with a Pull Request can be tricky. There are a lot of small steps that need to be done in the right order otherwise you may get hung up on a strange error. The nice thing with Git is that its really hard to permanently loose your work.  Check out the [PR Cheat Sheet](/guides/contributorguide/pr-cheat-sheet/) for the steps on doing a Pull Request. Go through this before starting any changes since a proper setup will make the merge easier down the road.
